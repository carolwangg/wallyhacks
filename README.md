# EnviroFlame 
A smart wildfire and illegal logging detection system designed to monitor environmental conditions in real time. Powered by the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Why did we build this?
Deforestation—the systematic clearing of forests, primarily due to human activities—has been drastically altering ecosystems worldwide. Factors such as urbanization, agricultural expansion, and illegal logging contribute to this issue, leading to habitat loss and an increased risk of wildfires. As deforestation continues unabated, it creates a more conducive environment for wildfires to ignite and spread, leading to a vicious cycle that threatens biodiversity, disrupts local climate patterns, and endangers communities.

## Project Overview
By analyzing sensor data, EnviroFlame provides real-time updates of the temperature, humidity and noise level of natural forested areas and sends automatic alerts to authorities when wildfire risks or illegal activities are detected. Our prototype is built using an ESP32 microcontroller, allowing for efficient data collection and transmission. The final design will incorporate fireproof and waterproof materials: fire-rated gypsum board, mineral wool, intumescent coatings, and fire-resistant sealants to ensure durability in forested environments. EnviroFlame devices are intended to be mounted on trees or buried at their roots, strategically distributed across protected forested areas for optimal coverage. They will be camouflaged within nature to prevent disturbances to natural habitats.
